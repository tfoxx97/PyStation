# PyStation
My first full flask app that is a blogpost/article style app for keeping Python tips/tricks organized.

## Purpose

Purpose of this app is to keep every bit of knowledge as well as life hacks regarding Python programming that I have learned through various sources or through trial and error.  The app is in a blogpost style because I wanted to incorporate code examples and visual elements that help me better understand whatever topic the post is about.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Flask - Python framework
- SQLAclhemy
